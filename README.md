Hello everyone! This project is basically a node version of the hangman game that i made! If you want to play, run the following command:  node main.js
Now, let me explain how this game works:

Step 1: A random word will be chosen from the computer. The theme is colors! But you'll know once you run the webpage.

Step 2: You try to guess a letter.

Step 3: If you guess wrong, you use up a guess, and must try again. Don't worry, the letters you have tried will be displayed below! If you guess correctly, though, one or more of the blanks will be filled with the letter. 

Step 4a: If you can figure out all the letters, you win!

Step 4b: If you use up all the guesses, you lose!

And that's all! Please enjoy the game!
